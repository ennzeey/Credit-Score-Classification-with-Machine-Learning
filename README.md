# Credit-Score-Classification-with-Machine-Learning

## Project Aim
Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. It facilitates the quick issuance of loans to clients with good creditworthiness by banks and credit card providers.These days, machine learning algorithms are used by banks and credit card firms to categorize all of the consumers in their database according to their credit history. We'd be build a machine learning algorithm to classify customers who wants to apply for a loan.

### Credit Score Classification
Banks and credit card issuers categorise their consumers based on three credit scores:

• Good

• Standard

• Poor

A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution. 

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The datasets has several columns but wwe would be predicting our creditworthiness  on the "Credit_Score" column
we also found differents insights based on the customer information

### Now to the Credit Score Classification Model
There are various ML classification model to select from but for this project made use of 

• Logistic Regression Classifier

• Using RandomForest Classifier 

• Using DecisionTree Classifier

RandomForest Classsifier performed the best with 81% accuracy, you can also try other classification model
